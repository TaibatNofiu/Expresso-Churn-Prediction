## Instructions

Install the necessary packages
Import you data and perform basic data exploration phase
Display general information about the dataset
Create a pandas profiling reports to gain insights into the dataset
Handle Missing and corrupted values
Remove duplicates, if they exist
Handle outliers, if they exist
Encode categorical features
Based on the previous data exploration train and test a machine learning classifier
Create a streamlit application (locally)
Add input fields for your features and a validation button at the end of the form
Import your ML model into the streamlit application and start making predictions given the provided features values
